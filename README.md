# Prosper Loan Dataset Exploration
## by Jeremy Monger

## Dataset

In this project I explored the Prosper Loan Dataset. It contains information on over 130,000 loans originating through its service.


## Summary of Findings

I discovered a ton of interesting things.

- Prosper went through a "quite period" where these ceased giving loans.
- Prosper's various rating system give a good idea of risk of a borrower defaulting.
- Higher risk borrowers pay higher interest rates.
- Many variables have correlation with the rating systems.
- Loan lengths were overwhelmingly 36 months.
- Debt consolidation is the largest reason borrower's take out a loan, with "Not Specified" also being extremely common.
- Homeowners were usually more likely to complete their loans, but not in the lead up to the Great Recession.


## Key Insights for Presentation

The first part of my presentation focuses on explaining how Rating relates to the proportion of loans in that category that successfully complete their loans (risk) and the interest rates in that category (reward). The goal is give an overall idea of the dataset.

Once this is established, I try to find my interesting discovery, that homeowners, while typically more likely to complete their loan, fared worse if they had taken out their loan right before the recession.
